You will be seeing the tasks imported from Jira, you can easily attach skill and tool you use for this specific task like above. 

Once you've entered any skill or tool you will see the box (crate) got colored. There is one more step, once you move your task to Done state in Jira, you can open the box and collect experience points in your profile. 


**How experience points are calculated ?**

Experience points are calculated by patron's neural network based on time spent with specific skill.
